# PCG-play-bot

## Description
This is a tool developed to auto play **Pokemon Community Game** for you while you work. Yes, because, in late capitalism, machines play and have fun while you do the boring work.

This bot allows you to:

- Throw pokeballs according to the Pokemon tier, following user-customized settings on the settings page.
- Automatically purchase pokeballs following your settings.
- You can also keep only the chat active to receive poke coins.

## Warning
This program uses unconventional methods to extract the authorization token from Twitch and connect to PCG. Twitch and PCG may consider these practices illegal and/or abusive, and your account may be subject to punishment and banning. Use it at your own risk.

Using this program on an account where there is already a chat bot connected may result in strange behaviour.
